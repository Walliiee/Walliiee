# Hola Mike, Mickey, Michael, Hulk, Thor, Walliiee or whatever suit you 👋

If you're reading this, it's too late.
**Great Listener, Always Curious, Challenge Seeker**

Prior to December 2024, I hadn't built anything and only had a foundational knowledge of software development and design.
Now I build stuff and I learn every darn day - and it's exactly how I want it to be.

## ✨ About Me
My Age: 32 years, 1 months, 20 days, 855 minutes
- Father, husband and a great friend and a hint of too much empathy, that leads me to want to solve all of the worlds problems and help everybody I meet.
- Oh and then I like to learn.
- I like to explore.
- I like challenges.
- When I start something I go all in. I listen, read and do until I understand and then I keep iterating on that.

## 🔧 Languages & Tools
- **Languages:** Mostly ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.9%2B-blue), a bit of ![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-F7DF1E?style=flat&logo=javascript&logoColor=black)   and ![CSS](https://img.shields.io/badge/CSS-1572B6?style=flat&logo=css3&logoColor=white). Also ![R](https://img.shields.io/badge/R-4.0.5-blue?style=flat&logo=R) but really no thank you...
- **Frameworks & Libraries:** FE: ![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/React-17.0.2-blue) most, bit of ![Bootstrap](https://img.shields.io/badge/Bootstrap-v5-blue?style=flat&logo=bootstrap). Most ![FastAPI](https://img.shields.io/badge/FastAPI-0.70.0-green?style=flat&logo=fastapi), a bit of ![Flask](https://img.shields.io/badge/Flask-2.0-lightgrey?style=flat&logo=flask)
- **Tools:** ![Docker](https://img.shields.io/badge/Docker-20.10.8-blue?style=flat&logo=docker), ![Jupyter Notebook](https://img.shields.io/badge/Jupyter%20Notebook-F37626?style=flat&logo=jupyter)
- **IDE:** ![Cursor](https://img.shields.io/badge/Cursor-IDE-ff69b4?style=flat) & ![VS Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code-1.60.0-blue?style=flat&logo=visual-studio-code)
- **Other Interests:** Staying healthy in mind and body. Football, American Football most but other sports have a wee bit of interest as well. GenAI because damn, can we make some awesome things happen!
- **80/20 Principle:** Most things in life you don't have to master more than 80% and you can do it with 20% of the effort. Pick one MAX two things to fully focus on but the rest should be 80/20. For me that goes for making great coffee and sour dough, the rest is only for the margins and for specialists.

  6 different RAG models with specified system prompts and parameters.  

- **Heatmap Project**
  Can't release it yet. Part of an internal project.
  Application for visualizing GenAI conversational usage (Claude and ChatGPT for now), in a calendar heatmap using Plotly Calplot, also analyzing usage data individually and combined.
  Data processing on a wide range of conversational data to embed and cluster, to be able to classify conversational topics upon upload.
